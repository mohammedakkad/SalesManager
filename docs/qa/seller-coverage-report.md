# Seller measured coverage

Debug JVM tests only. Not device/instrumentation or minified release coverage. Counts include compiled production classes, generated classes and compiler-generated branches; no production exclusions. Partial lines count as covered in JaCoCo line totals, while the gap CSV also identifies lines with any missed instructions.

Exact class counters: seller-class-coverage-gaps.csv. Exact source line and branch gaps: seller-coverage-gaps.csv (branch counts per line; no true/false labels in JaCoCo XML). HTML and XML: each module build/reports/jacoco/qaCoverage/. No claim of 100% coverage or absence of defects. Initial production baseline had no tests/reports and was unmeasured; no verified numeric baseline was reduced. Reviewed CI floors in coverage-thresholds.json are based on measured module baselines with a small fixed margin for scheduled/generated paths; they are raised explicitly, never rewritten automatically by a test run.

Remaining coverage: repository/DAO/migration faults, activation, sync conflicts/process interruption, cash/stock atomicity, backup restore/PDF, every Compose screen and navigation journey, workers/update behavior and release runtime. Full component inventory and test strategy identify the required continuation.


## Toward100% — additional boundary qualification

Current local source:394 JVM cases PASS (shared135/Seller259),0 failures/errors/skips;39 net new cases since94a2e48. Seller lines13158/17813=73.8674%; weighted20752/28082=73.8979%; weighted branches7849/17365=45.2001%. Eleven Python coverage guard tests PASS. The original JVM70% gates and inclusion policy remain unchanged. Literal100% is NOT achieved;4655 Seller lines and7330 weighted lines are still missed by JVM execution.

New failing-before/passing-after regressions repair the late invoice-load preview (displayed150/committed160 now both160), daily cash end boundary (half-open local day includes23:59:59.999), and duplicate product-save submissions (2 writes now1; explicit failure allows a controlled retry). Six invoice-editor contracts, two product-submit contracts and one day-boundary case pass. Three additional actual Room/WorkManager reminder cases verify customer totals/navigation, recent/paid exclusions and no debt mutation. No schema or financial formula changed.

Full JVM/JaCoCo/gates/Lint/Debug/AndroidTest/minified unsigned Release acceptance PASS; final test-only suite and updated AndroidTest APK PASS. Lint0 errors/24 warnings; targeted secret policy PASS. Authentic schemas remain22–25, current Room25; historical1–21 remainBLOCKED. Before/after and final evidence:coverage100/editor/,day-boundary/,product-submit/,boundaries-final/.

Hosted run42640961313 atb7b8d33:SellerSUCCESS, ComposeFAILURE (emulator action), artifact uploadSUCCESS. Exact failure/device XML was unavailable from public logs; no individual device/PDF success is claimed. Public actual-XML and measured-counter annotations plus stage/exit diagnostics were added for the next run, alongside retained artifacts and summary reports. Statement fixture now uses fractional20.25/30.50 with strict total50.75 assertions; integer monetary formatting was never a fixed-two-decimal contract. Original invoice assertions remain unchanged. New full hosted source verification is pending.

Remaining defined plan:70 work items (38NOT TESTED/32BLOCKED), after closingLOG-01/02/06 with actual regressions. These are work items, not an exhaustive finite count of all possible tests. See remaining-test-plan.csv and evidence/continuation/coverage100/final/test-inventory.json. Server authorization/fencing, partial Firestore/RTDB reconciliation, legacy tenant/cache ownership, cross-device identities, historical fixtures and signed upgrades remain release blockers.
