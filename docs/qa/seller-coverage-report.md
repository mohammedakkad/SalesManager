# Seller measured coverage

Debug JVM tests only. Not device/instrumentation or minified release coverage. Counts include compiled production classes, generated classes and compiler-generated branches; no production exclusions. Partial lines count as covered in JaCoCo line totals, while the gap CSV also identifies lines with any missed instructions.

Exact class counters: seller-class-coverage-gaps.csv. Exact source line and branch gaps: seller-coverage-gaps.csv (branch counts per line; no true/false labels in JaCoCo XML). HTML and XML: each module build/reports/jacoco/qaCoverage/. No claim of 100% coverage or absence of defects. Initial production baseline had no tests/reports and was unmeasured; no verified numeric baseline was reduced. Reviewed CI floors in coverage-thresholds.json are based on measured module baselines with a small fixed margin for scheduled/generated paths; they are raised explicitly, never rewritten automatically by a test run.

Remaining coverage: repository/DAO/migration faults, activation, sync conflicts/process interruption, cash/stock atomicity, backup restore/PDF, every Compose screen and navigation journey, workers/update behavior and release runtime. Full component inventory and test strategy identify the required continuation.


## Expanded activation qualification tests

Test-only qualification expansion:6 new real Room/network-fake cases cover unit download failure, product-unit SQL failure after earlier writes, successful catalog import with network outside Room, account switch during fetch, cancellation during unit download and cancellation during cash insertion. Snapshot comparisons now include product/unit, invoice, return, receipt/outbox and cash ledgers. Targeted10 import tests and complete221 JVM tests PASS (shared95/Seller126),0 failures/errors/skips. Both Test tasks executed; complete Gradle run succeeded in1m15s. Unchanged coverage gates and targeted secret policy PASS. Weighted lines4980/28061 =17.7471%, branches1348/17329 =7.7789%; Seller lines1123/17794 =6.3111%, branches705/14312 =4.9259%. No production, Admin, schema, financial-rule or coverage-floor changes; no new repair or failing-before claim is made for these6 qualification cases. Lint/APKs were not rerun in this test-only increment; the unchanged production source has successful prior local/hosted acceptance at129490d. New test-HEAD hosted validation is pending. Real Firebase/device/PDF artifact-counter limits and server-rule/tenant/distributed blockers remain; release readiness FAIL. Evidence:stage11-expanded-tests/.


## Hosted expanded-test acceptance

Hosted qualification completed:Seller QA run42577182702 at test HEADa717f9ee11d87953a70ebecf21a4331406331142 is SUCCESS (https://github.com/mohammedakkad/SalesManager/actions/runs/42577182702). Both seller and compose completed successfully, including hosted test/coverage/lint/Debug, minified unsigned Release, emulator and artifact steps. This supersedes the pending status for the six-test expansion. Local221 passing JVM tests are recorded from actual JUnit XML; raw hosted XML/PDF counters were not separately downloaded. Sanitized public job evidence:stage11-expanded-tests/hosted-success.json. Subsequent documentation-only CI is not claimed complete. No production/Admin/schema changes occurred in the test expansion. Release readiness remainsFAIL for previously documented server/tenant/distributed/upgrade limits.
